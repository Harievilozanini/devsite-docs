## How to manage customer sales on my site

In order to manage sellers and for them to be able to perform commercial transactions in your site, you must [create a Marketplace](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/marketplace/web-checkout/introduction).

A Marketplace is a site or app that allows you to make collections on behalf of sellers and charge a commission for each one if you wish. When a payment is generated, the money is instantly divided between your seller's account and yours.
