# Create a subscription

Through your Mercado Pago account you can create a subscription link that can be sent to your buyers and allow you to receive payments on a regular basis. You can use it to: collect gym fees, collect rents or receive donations.

You do not need to know programming.

We will guide you so that you can set the:

* Fixed or variable amount (at the buyerâ€™s choice).
* Payment frequency: weekly, fortnightly, monthly.
* Subscription duration: unlimited or limited to a number of charges.

You will get a **link** that you can send by e-mail, post on social networks, or wherever you want.

In addition **we will provide you** with an **HTML Code** that you can include in your website and a **QR Code** for you **to share** with your customers.

>In Argentina, VISA cards take up to 48 hours to be processed, so your payments will remain outstanding during that period.

>If you want to build something more advanced and personalized, check our documentation of [Subscriptions via API](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/subscriptions/api/introduction).
