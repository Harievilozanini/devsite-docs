# Receive payments in Gateway mode

> WARNING
>
> Prerequisites
>
> * Have the [card information capture](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/payments/api/receiving-payment-by-card#bookmark_collect_card_information) implemented.

## Additional attributes

Once you have completed the card information capture flow and have the card_token, you will be able to generate the payment.

To use the Gateway mode, two attributes are added to the payment processing flow:
processing_mode.
1. `merchant_account_id` _(optional)_
2. `processing_mode`

### processing\_mode

It is the mode that indicates if we will process the payments with your merchant numbers or those of Mercado Pago.

If this parameter is not sent in the *POST^, the default value is `aggregator`, indicating that the payment was processed using the merchant numbers of Mercado Pago.

If you want to process it with your merchant numbers, you must send the `gateway`. Automatically, according to the payment method and the BIN numbers, Mercado Pago will use the corresponding merchant number for that transaction.

> NOTE

> Note
>
> To request the registration of the Gateway mode and the configuration of your merchant numbers, contact your account manager.

### merchant_account_id

In more complex cases, it is useful to be able to determine the merchant number to be used for each payment.

The `merchant_account_id` attribute allows you to control this behavior. This ID will be the internal identifier of Mercado Pago that represents a particular merchant number.

## Create a payment

Once you have the id of the `card_token` you can make the payment by making an API call:

```php
<?php
  require ('mercadopago.php');

  // Setup your private key
  $mp = new MP('ENV_ACCESS_TOKEN');

  $payment_data = array(
      "transaction_amount" => 100,
      "token" => "ff8080814c11e237014c1ff593b57b4d",
      "payment_method_id" => "visa",
      "payer" => array (
          "email" => "test_user_19653727@testuser.com"
      ),
      "processing_mode" => "gateway",
      "merchant_account_id" => "ID"
  );

  $payment = $mp->post("/v1/payments", $payment_data);
?>
```

The expected response will be as follows:

```json
{
  "id": 1060255593,
  "operation_type": "regular_payment",
  "payment_method_id": "visa",
  ...
  "processing_mode": "gateway",
  "merchant_account_id": "#hashMerchantAccountID",
  "acquirer": "visa",
  "merchant_number": "1234567",
  "acquirer_reconciliation":{...}
}
```

In addition to returning the `processing_mode` and `merchant_account_id` fields, three more fields are added:

* `acquirer`: Name of the acquirer
* `merchant_number`: Merchant number used to process the payment
* `acquirer_reconciliation`: Fields to reconcile with the credit card resume
  * `authorization_code`
  * `batch_closing_date`
  * `batch_number`
  * `date_created`
  * `date_last_updated`
  * `operation`
  * `refund_id`
  * `terminal_number`
  * `transaction_number`

## Create a payment in installments

To make use of your bank promotions, it is important to send the `installments` field and `processing_mode` in `gateway` when creating a payment.

The `installments` field corresponds to the number of installments selected by the customer.

In order to get the promotions and installments available:

```javascript
Mercadopago.getInstallments({
    "bin": bin,
    "amount": amount,
}, setInstallmentInfo);
```

The response of the API in case of having on both gateway and aggregator mode on will be each model items with the information about the installments available indicating the amount payable:

In the integration you will have to choose which of the modes is going to be used for that payment adding the field mentioned above
```json

        {
            "payment_method_id": "amex",
            "payment_type_id": "credit_card",
